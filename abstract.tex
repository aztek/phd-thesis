Automated theorem provers are computer programs that check if a logical conjecture follows from a set of logical statements. The conjecture and the statements are expressed in the language of a formal logic, such as first-order logic. Expressivity of first-order logic makes it convenient for writing problems coming from diverse application domains. As a result, theorem provers for first-order logic have been used for automation in proof assistants, verification of programs, static analysis of networks, and other purposes. Despite the success of theorem provers for first-order logic, their efficient use remains challenging. One of the challenges is the difficulty of translating the domain problem to first-order logic. Not only can a translation be cumbersome due to semantic differences between the domain and the logic, but it might inadvertently result in a problem that is hard for a theorem prover.

The work presented in the thesis addresses this challenge by developing an extension of first-order logic named FOOL. FOOL is friendly for translation of problems from various domains and can be efficiently supported by existing theorem provers. We describe the syntax and symantics of FOOL and present a naive translation from FOOL to plain first-order logic. We describe a more efficient clausal normal form transformation algorithm for FOOL and based on it implement a support for FOOL in the Vampire theorem prover. We illustrate the efficient use of FOOL for program verification by describing a concise encoding of next state relations of imperative programs in FOOL. We demonstrate the efficiency of automated theorem proving in FOOL with an extensive set of experiments. In these experiments we compare the performance of Vampire on a large collection of problems from various sources translated to FOOL and ordinary first-order logic. Finally, we fix the syntax for FOOL in TPTP, the standard language of first-order theorem provers.
