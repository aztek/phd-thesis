I am indebted to many people who in different ways supported me during these past five years.

I would like to thank my supervisor Laura Kov\'acs for setting me on the path that eventually led to this thesis and her help along the way. I am grateful to my co-supervisor Andrei Voronkov for his guidance and for showing me how academic work should be approached. I want to thank my local co-supervisor Moa Johansson for always being ready to help and my examiner Koen Claessen for his good advice and timely support. To my collaborators Martin Suda and Giles Reger, thank you for the insightful discussions about automated reasoning that we had. I am grateful to Byron Cook for inviting me to visit Amazon Web Services and for the great time that I had there.

I was lucky to be surrounded by a lot of amazing colleagues and friends at Chalmers. Daniel~H., Daniel~S., Iulia, Jeff, Mauricio, Ra\'ul, Pablo, Simon and others, thank you for all the amazing time we spent together. Another thank you goes to Carlo, Grischa, Enzo, Marco and Pier for sharing my interest in music. I hope we will get to play more gigs in the future.

Finally, a very special thank you goes to Lydia for her continuous support and patience.
